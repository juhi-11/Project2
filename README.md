# Sentiment Analysis using Naive Bayes Classification
The projects use Python and Naive Bayes Algorithm for training on two different datasets. Further, LIME (Local Intepretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) has been integrated, it is a technique that approximates any black box machine learning model with a local, interpretable model to explain each individual prediction.
